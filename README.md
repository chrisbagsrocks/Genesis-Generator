# Genesis Generator
A python script for creating the parameters required for a unique genesis block. SHA256/scrypt/X11/X13/X15.
## Please Read First
I struggled using this program for about a week due to the poor "writeups". Many have cloned this but never added anything to it, and seeing how the original creator has not updated it in years, I wanted to do my best to help as many people as possible. The original "Tutorial" gives little information on how to use the program to generate your own merkle root, genesis block, etc and more just how to replicate other chains information. I have modified it to make it easier for the average person to understand.

### Dependencies
    sudo pip install scrypt construct==2.5.2
    
```
sudo apt install git
```

To create geneses based on X11 algorithm you will also need to install the [x11 Hash](https://github.com/chrisbagsrocks/X11-Hash) module. 
For X13 you will need the [x13 Hash](https://github.com/chrisbagsrocks/X13-Hash) module and for X15 the [x15 Hash](https://github.com/chrisbagsrocks/X15-Hash) module.

<details><summary>Understanding Code</summary>
<p>
    
Something not mentioned anywhere except in the code, is that there are defaults set, so if an item is left blank, the code will default to: 

The message in your genesis block, can be changed to anything. Many coins use a news article that was influential during that time.
```
"-z", "--timestamp", dest="timestamp", default="The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks",
```
nonce is an abbreviation for "number only used once, it is the number that blockchain miners are solving to receive the block reward.
```
"-n", "--nonce", dest="nonce", default=0,
```
Makes default algorithm SHA256, which is for Bitcoin
```
"-a", "--algorithm", dest="algorithm", default="SHA256",
```
Sets Public key to a random key without knowing private key
```
"-p", "--pubkey", dest="pubkey", default="04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f",
```
This is the last value in your src/chainparams.cpp file looking at the CreateGenesisBlocks section. Take the "50 * COIN" value, 

50 * 100000000 = 5000000000. This is the output for the genesis block, It's best to leave it default just for ease of use 
```
"-v", "--value", dest="value", default=5000000000,
```
All except bits (-b) include a default in code but the bits will default to 0x1e0ffff0 which is the lowest difficulty for the genesis block

## 1. Generate a Private and Public Key
You will need a few things, first you need to generate a Private key and use that to generate a Public key. You can use many programs to do this, just make sure you are not using an online generator. That may put your project at risk if they log the private keys. Use something local, you can run the command: 
```
openssl rand -hex 32 
``` 
which will output a secure 32-bit private key, which can be used to generate a public key with: 

[blockchain-dev-tools](https://github.com/chrisbagsrocks/blockchain-dev-tools) with command ```./pubkey.py -u YOUR PRIVATE KEY```

You must define "COIN" with two commands, ```COIN=examplecoin``` and ```export COIN```
    
## 2. Download Repo and Prepare Command
On your Desktop,
```
git clone https://github.com/chrisbagsrocks/Genesis-Generator.git && cd Genesis-Generator
```
Now that we are in the directory, we need to prepare the command to find our parameters. An important thing to note is the difference in ```"``` vs ```???```. Very similar parenthesis, but ```???``` causes errors and ```"``` will allow you to put your full pszTimestamp.

At the bottom of the Examples tab, it includes 2 examples on what it SHOULD look like. Before starting you will need to know:
	
Algorithm (-a) - [SHA256|scrypt|X11|X13|X15]
	
pszTimestamp (-z) - Piece of text that is used in Genesis Block
	
pubkey (-p) Generated in Step 1, should be 130 characters long.
	
time (-t) Epoch Time can be calculated with command ```date +%s``` or [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/)

### Optional
	
If you were to look at Bitcoins chainparams.cpp, you will see a line that says: 

```genesis = CreateGenesisBlock(1231006505, 2083236893, 0x1d00ffff, 1, 50 * COIN);```
	
nonce (-n) - By default is 0 in equation but will output a different number. Equivalent to ```2083236893``` in Bitcoin File.
	
value (-v) - By default is 5000000000. Calculated by multiplying "Coin Value" by 100000000. Equivalent to ```50``` in Bitcoin File.
	
bits (-b) - By default is 1. This is the genesis blocks mining difficulty. Equivalent to ```0x1d00ffff``` in Bitcoin File.
